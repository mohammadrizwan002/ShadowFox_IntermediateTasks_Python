## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab
- BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
- requests (for making HTTP requests)
- random (for word selection in Hangman)
- string (for validating character inputs)

## Notes

- Both tasks were coded in Google Colab notebooks.
- Each notebook is self-contained with comments for clarity.
- Outputs and functionality were verified through interactive runs.
- This repository is part of the Intermediate Level submission for the ShadowFox Internship (Python Development).
